# Perfect Crosswords

A collection of densely packed crosswords, inspired by Games Magazine's contests.

Given a wordlist, the goal is to put the biggest number of words in a grid.
The words can be placed horizontally or vertically.
All the words in the grid must be in the wordlist.

When several solutions exist with the same number of words, the grid with the most letters wins.

Each folder contains a wordlist and the best solutions currently known.
